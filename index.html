    <header>Vodka</header>
    <article class="main-article">
      <p>Vodka, distilled liquor, clear in colour and without definite aroma or taste, ranging in alcoholic content from about 40 to 55 percent. Because it is highly neutral, with flavouring substances mainly eliminated during processing, it can be made from a mash of the cheapest and most readily available raw materials suitable for fermentation. Potatoes were traditionally employed in Russia and Poland but have largely been supplanted there and in other vodka-producing countries by cereal grains.</p>
      <p>Vodka originated in Russia during the 14th century, and the name is a diminutive of the Russian voda (“water”). The beverage was mainly popular in Russia, Poland, and the Balkan states until soon after World War II, when consumption began to increase rapidly in the United States and then in Europe. Most producers purchase previously distilled and purified neutral spirits that are extremely high in alcohol content, with almost no flavouring substances remaining. Such spirits are then additionally purified by a filtration process, usually employing charcoal, and are then reduced in strength with distilled water and bottled without aging.</p>
      <p>In Russia, where fairly low alcohol content of<code> 40 percent by volume (80 U.S. proof)</code> is preferred, and in Poland, where 45 percent is more common, vodka is usually consumed unmixed and chilled, in small glasses, and accompanied by appetizers. In other countries it is popular for use in mixed drinks because of its neutral character. It may be combined with other beverages without imparting flavour of its own and substituted for other spirits in cocktails not requiring the specific flavour of the original spirit. Popular vodka drinks include the screwdriver, made with orange juice; the bloody Mary, with tomato juice; vodka and tonic, a tall drink; and the vodka martini, with vodka substituted for gin.</p>
      <p>Vodkas are sometimes flavoured with such ingredients as buffalo grass, lemon peel, berries, peppercorns, and caraway.</p>

    <header>Gin</header>
    <article class="main-article">
      <p>Gin, flavoured, distilled, colourless to pale yellow liquor made from purified spirits usually obtained from a grain mash and having the juniper berry as its principal flavouring ingredient. It includes both the malty-flavoured and full-bodied Netherlands types and the drier types, characterized by distinct botanical flavouring, produced in Britain and the United States. The name of the beverage comes from the French name for the juniper berry, genièvre, altered by the Dutch to genever and shortened by the English to gin. Its origin is attributed to Franciscus Sylvius, a 17th-century professor of medicine at the University of Leiden in Holland, who distilled the juniper berry with spirits to produce an inexpensive medicine having the diuretic properties of juniper-berry oil. The beverage became popular and was introduced to England by soldiers returning from the Low Countries. In the 18th century excessive consumption of the inexpensive beverage presented a social problem, as depicted in William Hogarth’s engraving "Gin Lane".</p>
      <p>Netherlands gins, known as Hollands, geneva, genever, or Schiedam, for a distilling centre near Rotterdam, are made from a mash containing barley malt, fermented to make beer. The beer is distilled, producing spirits called malt wine,<code> with 50–55 percent alcohol content by volume</code>. This product is distilled again with juniper berries and other botanicals, producing a final product having alcoholic content of about 35 percent. English and American gins are distilled from malt wine purified to produce an almost neutral spirit, without flavour or aroma, having alcohol content of 90–94 percent by volume. This is reduced with distilled water, combined with the flavouring agents, and distilled and reduced again, producing a final product of <code>40–47 percent alcoholic content (80–94 U.S. proof)</code>. The dry gins have more added flavouring ingredients than Dutch types. Each producer employs a secret formula, including, in addition to the juniper berries, combinations of such botanicals as orris, angelica, and licorice roots, lemon and orange peels, cassia bark, caraway, coriander, cardamom, anise, and fennel.</p>
      <p>United States producers sometimes age their gins, imparting pale-golden colour. Dutch gins may have similar colour, resulting from the addition of caramel colouring. Old Tom is a slightly sweetened gin, and various fruit-flavoured gins are made by adding the appropriate flavourings to finished gin. Sloe gin is not a true gin but a sweet liqueur, flavoured with sloe berries, the small, sour fruit of the blackthorn.
      <p>Dutch gins, too distinctive in taste to combine well with other beverages, are usually served unmixed or with water. The drier types, sometimes called London dry, may be served unmixed or may be combined with other ingredients to make such cocktails as the martini and gimlet and such long drinks as the Tom Collins and the gin and tonic.</p>

  <section id="Rum" class="main-section">
    <header>Rum</header>
    <article class="main-article">
      <p>Rum, distilled liquor made from sugarcane products, usually produced as a by-product of sugar manufacture. It includes both the light-bodied rums, typified by those of Cuba and Puerto Rico, and the heavier and fuller-flavoured rums of Jamaica.</p>
      <p>Rums originated in the West Indies and are first mentioned in records from Barbados in about 1650. They were called “kill-devil” or “rumbullion” and by 1667 were simply called rum. Rum figured in the slave trade of the American colonies: slaves were brought from Africa and traded to the West Indies for molasses; the molasses was made into rum in New England; and the rum was then traded to Africa for more slaves. British sailors received regular rations of rum from the 18th century until 1970. Rum, the major liquor distilled during the early history of the United States, was sometimes mixed with molasses and called blackstrap or mixed with cider to produce a beverage called stonewall.</p>
      <p>Most rums are made from molasses, the residue remaining after sugar has been crystallized from sugarcane juice, containing as much as 5 percent sugar. Some countries import molasses for use in rum production. Where sugar industries are undeveloped, rum is often made with sugarcane juice. A low-quality spirit, called tafia, is made from impure molasses or other sugarcane residue, but it is not considered a true rum and is seldom exported. The sugar necessary for fermentation is already present in the raw material, and rum retains more of the original raw-material taste than most other spirits. The characteristic flavour of specific rums is determined by the type of yeast employed for fermentation, the distillation method, aging conditions, and blending.</p>
      <p>The heavy, dark, and full-bodied rums are the oldest type and have strong molasses flavour. They are primarily produced in Jamaica, Barbados, and Demerara in Guyana. Such rums are usually produced from molasses enriched with the skimmings, or dunder, remaining in the boilers used for sugar production. This liquid attracts yeast spores from the air, resulting in spontaneous, or natural, fermentation. The resulting slow fermentation period allows full development of flavour substances. The rum is distilled twice in simple pot stills, producing a distillate of clear colour that turns to a golden hue as the distillate takes up substances from the oak of the wooden puncheons used for storage during the aging period. Colour is deepened by the addition of caramel after aging. The Jamaican rums are always blended and are aged for at least five to seven years. They are usually marketed with an<code> alcohol content of 43–49 percent by volume (86–98 U.S. proof)</code>. New England rum, made in the United States for over 300 years, has strong flavour and high alcohol content. Batavia arak is a pungent rum produced on the Indonesian island of Java.</p>
      <p>The production of dry, light-bodied rums began in the late 19th century. This type, produced mainly in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, employs cultured yeast in fermentation, and distillation is accomplished in modern, continuous-operation patent stills. The rums are usually blended and are aged from one to four years. Those rums marketed as white-label types are pale in colour and mild in flavour; a gold-label rum has a more amber colour and more pronounced and sweeter flavour, resulting from longer aging and the addition of caramel.</p>
      <p>Straight rum is a popular drink in rum-producing countries. Elsewhere, rum is usually consumed in mixed drinks, with light rums preferred for such cocktails as the daiquiri and dark rums used in such tall drinks as the rum Collins. Rum is frequently used as a flavouring in dessert sauces and other dishes. It is also used to flavour tobacco.</p>

  <section id="Whiskey" class="main-section">
    <header>Whiskey</header>
    <article class="main-article">
      <p>Whiskey, also spelled whisky, any of several distilled liquors made from a fermented mash of cereal grains and including Scotch, Irish, and Canadian whiskeys and the various whiskeys of the United States. Whiskey is always aged in wooden containers, usually of white oak. The name, spelled without an e by the Scots and Canadians and with an e in Ireland and the United States, comes from the Celtic usquebaugh (Irish uisce beathadh, Scots Gaelic uisge beatha, both adaptations of the Latin phrase aqua vitae, meaning “water of life”). The earliest direct account of whiskey making is found in Scottish records dating from 1494.</p>
      <p>What’s the Difference Between Whiskey and Whisky? What About Scotch, Bourbon, and Rye? Well, when whiskey, or whisky, or Scotch, or bourbon, or rye are in a name, it can tell you a lot about the spirit.</p>
      <p>The whiskeys produced in each country are distinctive in character because of differences in the method of production, the type and character of the cereal grains, and the quality and character of the water employed.</p>
      <p>Straight whiskeys are unmixed or mixed only with whiskey from the same distillation period and distiller. Blended whiskeys include mixtures of similar products made by different distillers and in different periods (Scotch) and also whiskeys made with combinations of the neutral whiskeys (which have no distinctive flavour characteristics) and straight whiskeys (United States and Canada). Small quantities of other flavouring materials (e.g., sherry, fruit juices) may be included in blends. Governments may require that some whiskeys be aged under their supervision for specific periods.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scotch whiskys are somewhat light in body, with a distinctive smoky malt flavour. They are made primarily from barley that is malted and then heated over a peat fire, the oily, acrid smoke of which flavours the malt. Variations among whiskys of the Highlands, Lowlands, Campbeltown, and Islay regions are caused partly by differences in the amount of heating the malt receives. The flavoured malt is combined with water, producing a mash, and then fermented to make a beer. When the beer is distilled, it produces a whisky containing<code> 70 percent alcohol by volume (i.e., 140 U.S. proof)</code>. This product is successively reduced with water to about<code> 43 percent by volume</code>.</li>
        <li>Irish whiskeys taste much like Scotch but without the smoky quality. They are produced by methods similar to those for Scotch whisky, but the malt is not exposed to smoke during roasting. Irish whiskeys pass through three distillations and are sometimes blended with neutral grain whiskeys to produce a lighter-bodied product.</li>
        <li>The Canadian whisky industry began in the early 19th century. Canadian whiskys are light in body and flavour and are always blends of both highly flavoured and neutral grain whiskys. They are made from mashes composed of combinations of corn, rye, wheat, and barley malt prepared according to the formula of the individual producer. Canadian whiskys are usually aged for at least six years, then reduced with water to an alcoholic content of about 45 percent by volume before bottling.</li>
        <li>In the United States, whiskey production began early in the 18th century. Major distillation centres are established in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Their product is made with malt and other grains (usually corn or rye), producing a beer that is distilled to make a whiskey of 80 percent alcohol content by volume. This distillate, high in flavouring substances derived from the original raw materials, is reduced with water to about 50–52 percent alcohol and aged in unused    charred white-oak barrels. Straight whiskeys may be stored in government-bonded warehouses.</li>
        <li>Bourbon is characterized by the flavour of corn (maize), used as the main raw material. It was first produced in Bourbon county, Kentucky, and the name bourbon eventually became a general term for similar corn-mash whiskeys. Sour mashes, used mainly in bourbon production, are fermented with yeast, including a portion of previously fermented yeast; other whiskeys are made from sweet mashes, employing only fresh yeast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the United States, straight whiskeys are named for the grains predominating in the mash, with at least 51 percent required for whiskeys designated as straight. If a mash of at least 51 percent barley malt is employed, the product is straight malt whiskey; if rye malt is used, it is straight rye whiskey. Straight bourbon mashes contain at least 51 percent corn; straight corn-whiskey mashes contain at least 80 percent. Combinations of similar straight whiskeys of different distillation periods or from different distillers are designated as blended, rather than straight.</p>
      <p>Whiskeys are consumed both unmixed and mixed in cocktails, punches, and highballs. The United States is the world’s largest producer and consumer of whiskey.</p>

  <section id="Tequila" class= "main-section">
    <header>Tequila</header>
    <article class="main-article">
      <p>Tequila, distilled liquor, usually clear in colour and unaged, that is made from the fermented juice of the Mexican agave plant, specifically several varieties of Agave tequilana Weber. Tequila contains<code> 40–50 percent alcohol (80–100 U.S. proof)</code>. The beverage, which was developed soon after the Spaniards introduced distillation to Mexico, is named for the town of Tequila in the Mexican state of Jalisco where it is produced.</p>
      <p>Upon maturity the pineapple-like base of the agave plant fills with sweet sap, or agua miel (“honey water”). The bases are steamed to aid in extracting the sap; this juice is fermented and then distilled twice to achieve the desired purity. Some brands are aged in oak vats, which allows the distillate to mellow and take on a pale straw colour.</p>
      <p>Tequila is mixed with lime juice and an orange-flavoured liqueur to make the Margarita cocktail, which is served in a glass rimmed with salt. Mexicans usually prefer tequila unmixed, accompanied by salt and a wedge of lime. The drinker takes salt, tequila, and lime in rapid succession, thus combining all the flavours.</p>
      <p>Mescal (also known as mezcal), a similar distilled beverage, is less expensive and stronger in flavour and is made from an agave plant that grows wild in the Oaxaca region.</p>
